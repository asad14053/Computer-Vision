# Computer Vision and OpenCV

Welcome to the Computer Vision and OpenCV repository! This repository contains code and resources related to computer vision and image processing using OpenCV.

# What is Computer Vision?

Computer vision is a field of study that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and analyze visual data from the world. It involves the development of algorithms and techniques that allow computers to process, analyze, and understand visual information from the world around us. Computer vision has applications in a wide range of fields, including robotics, surveillance, medical imaging, and more.

# What is OpenCV?

OpenCV is an open-source computer vision library that provides a wide range of algorithms and techniques for image processing, object detection, and more. It is widely used in both industry and academia for computer vision research and development.
